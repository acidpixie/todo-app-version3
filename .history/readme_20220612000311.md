Welcome to my to-do app!

with this app you are able to create new tasks,
simply add in the inputs and select the big + button.

once you have added in all the tasks, they will
appear in a list under 'things to do...'

in this list you are able to sort the tasks by
a-z depending on the task name.
delete the tasks.
mark as complete by double clicking on the task
label 
and editing the task by clicking on the 
task label fields

you can also clear all tasks in the list by clicking on
the big x button.

!oh you can also add in your name next to 'Hello',
click on the placeholder name and type in your 
name :)
